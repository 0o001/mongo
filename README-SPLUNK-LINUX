Splunk Custom Build Linux
=========================

NOTE: We use 3 separate branches to build and test builds for Splunk:  Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

This is because signficant changes have to be made to build the tools on RHEL 5.5 Linux.  We also need to make some code changes to account for features
that are not available in the older OS.

Finally, Splunk requires different versions of openssl (and a specific location requirement on macOS requiring its own distro in Evergreen)
This would be hard to generalize in a single evergreen.yml in one branch.

Current branches:

splunk-linux-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439
splunk-macos-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439
splunk-windows-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439


We build on RHEL 5.5

Use the "linux64" variant for patches:

```
evergreen patch -p "mongodb-mongo-v3.6" -t "compile" -d "BUILD-10833 Splunk custom build of 3.6.17 with BACKPORT-6439" -v "linux-64" -u -f -y
```

Here is the last full patch build

We expect the below tests to fail:
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/BUILD-10428?focusedCommentId=2947636&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-2947636

jstestfuzz_*
multiverson_*
sharding_last_stable_mongos_and_mixed_shards
compile_all
serial_run_WT

In the near future, we will probably change the way we build and test these Linux versions per:
