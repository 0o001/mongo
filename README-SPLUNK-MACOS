Splunk Custom Build macOS
=========================

NOTE: We use 3 separate branches to build and test builds for Splunk:  Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

This is because signficant changes have to be made to build the tools on RHEL 5.5 Linux.  We also need to make some code changes to account for features
that are not available in the older OS.

Finally, Splunk requires different versions of openssl (and a specific location requirement on macOS requiring its own distro in Evergreen) 
This would be hard to generalize in a single evergreen.yml in one branch.

Current branches:

splunk-linux-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439
splunk-macos-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439
splunk-windows-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439

MacOS
-----

Note that a patch should only be run for MacOS on the macos-1012-splunk	distro in Evergreen.

Use this variant:

```
### SPLUNK
 - name: osx-1010-ssl
  display_name: SSL OS X 10.10 Splunk
   run_on:
-  - macos-1012
  ### SPLUNK
  - macos-1012-splunk
```

ie.

```
evergreen patch -p "mongodb-mongo-v3.6" -t "compile" -d "BUILD-11420 Splunk MacOS v3.6.17 with golang 1.13" -v "osx-1010-ssl" -u -f -y
```
