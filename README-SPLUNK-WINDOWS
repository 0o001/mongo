Splunk Custom Build Windows
===========================

NOTE: We use 3 separate branches to build and test builds for Splunk:  Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

This is because signficant changes have to be made to build the tools on RHEL 5.5 Linux.  We also need to make some code changes to account for features
that are not available in the older OS.

Finally, Splunk requires different versions of openssl (and a specific location requirement on macOS requiring its own distro in Evergreen) 
This would be hard to generalize in a single evergreen.yml in one branch.

Current branches:

splunk-linux-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439
splunk-macos-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439
splunk-windows-v3.6.17-BACKPORT-6439

Windows
-------

Splunk has been using the community releases of Windows and there isn't really anything we need to change for custom builds.

In this case we changed the version number and made sure that the version we gave them included SERVER-42525

When running a patch build, use this variant: `windows-64-2k8-ssl`

ie. 

```
evergreen patch -p "mongodb-mongo-v3.6" -t "compile" -d "BUILD-10833 Splunk custom build of 3.6.17 with BACKPORT-6439 WINDOWS" -v "windows-64-2k8-ssl" -u -f
```
